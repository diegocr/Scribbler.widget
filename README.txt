Scribbler used to be a handy multi-clipboard manager
designed as a widget for the Yahoo! Widgets Engine.

Used to be, you ask? Well, yeah... until Yahoo! 
Widgets became discontinued:

http://widgets.yahoo.com/widgets/scribbler


However, if you're still using Yahoo! Widgets you can 
of course give it a try, a binary/installable package
can be found under the name "Scribbler-5.0.widget"

The last relesed version by Reinier was 3.0 beta 8

This 5.0 version never saw the light, until now.

Check the file main.js for the list of changes.
